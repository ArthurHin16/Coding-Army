"""
You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.
Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

Note that:
    - The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
    - Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
    - The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
    - There will not be any division by zero.
    - The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
    - The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
