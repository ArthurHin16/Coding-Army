What is Backtracking?

Backtracking can be defined as a general algorithm technique that considers searching every possible combination in
order to solve a computational problem.

What is Backtracking algorithm?
Is an algorithmic technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time, 
removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time.

Recursion vs Backtracking
Recursion involves a function calling itself until it reaches the base case.
Backtracking uses recursion to discover all of the possibilities until we get the best end result for the problem.
