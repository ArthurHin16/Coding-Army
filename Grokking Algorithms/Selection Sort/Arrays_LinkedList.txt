Arrays and linked list

Using an array means all your tasks are stores contiguously in memory.
With linked list, your items can be anywhere in memory. Each item stores
the address of the next item in the list. A bunch of random memory addresses
are linked together.

Terminology: The elemts in an array are numbered. This numebring starts from 0,
not 1. The position of an element is called its index. 

Here are the run times for common operations on arrays and lists.

          | ARRAYS | LISTS
---------------------------
READING   |  O(1)  |  O(n)
---------------------------
INSERTION |  O(n)  |  O(1)
---------------------------
DELETEION |  O(n)  |  O(1)

Lists are better if you want to insert elements into the middle.
Lists are better at deletions, because you just need to change what the
previous element points to.

Arrays see a lot of use because they allow random access.
Sequential access means reading elements one by one, starting at the first element.
Linked list can only do sequential access.
